# Al-Sole
A website created for a web development class group project.  I handled all back-end server programming and a couple of aspects of the front-end/TPS-integration, such as superficial JS/PHP and some HTML/CSS layout aspects.  Hosted locally using WAMPServer64.

Includes an SQL file for proper functionality.
